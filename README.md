# ASU-Lost-and-Found
ASU Lost & Found is a simple, user-friendly website where students can report lost or found items at campus events. It allows users to quickly post details, search for missing belongings, and even connect with each other through an in-app messaging system. All interactions are secured by verifying ASU credentials, ensuring that only trusted members of the community participate.
Built the platform using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and used localStorage to persist data during development. The project was designed around a responsive interface with real-time updates, allowing users to post and search for items seamlessly. Integrated a basic messaging feature for direct communication between students, and a login system that uses ASU emails for authentication.
